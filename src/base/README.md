# Introduction

Even if you're the biggest proponent of [serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) architecture and you only use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and all other [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) serverless services, you understand that `Serverless = "someone else is responsible for these servers going down"`.

All [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) services are built upon three main pillars:

- Compute
- Storage
- Network

Taking this knowledge into account, it's very important to understand the
basics of:
- Network Protocols
- Web Application Scaling
- Differences between database architectures
- Session Handling

and much more.

So let's not wait and get started.
