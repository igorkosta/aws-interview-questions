# REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services.

The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. Fielding's dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the **HTTP object model** beginning in 1994, and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) standards.
