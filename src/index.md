[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is hands down - the biggest cloud provider. It
offers the biggest range of services compapred to  all other cloud provider
competitors, like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) has been able to attract the best talent on the market. Many software engineers and architects would love to work at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

In order to get hired, a candidate has to pass at least 3 interviews (and some
assesments):
- Initial Screening Interview with the Hiring Manager
- First interview with the person in the position similar to the one you're
  applying for
- 4-5 Consecutive Interviews (1-1.5 hours each) with people in similar
  positions

I failed at step 2 and to better prepared for my 2nd attempt decided to create
this documentation where I will try to post the questions to the answers I was
asked and help other to prepare for their interview at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Happy learning!
